# RFM analysis on Customer Invoice Data

## Business Problem : 

Identify different segments of customer for target marketing strategies


## Solution Approach 

1. RFM analysis stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary analysis. It's a popular technique used by businesses to segment their customers based on their purchasing behavior. This analysis helps in identifying groups of customers for targeted marketing strategies. 

- Recency (R): Recency refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase. To calculate recency, we determine the time difference between the most recent purchase date and the present date for each customer.

- Frequency (F): Frequency refers to how often a customer makes a purchase. To calculate frequency, count the number of purchases made by each customer within a given time period.

- Monetary (M): Monetary refers to how much money a customer spends. To calculate monetary value, sum up the total amount spent by each customer over a given period.



2. Use a K-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers based on their RFM values. The algorithm will assign each customer to one of the K clusters.

3. Interpret the Clusters: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand the different segments of customers. Look for patterns in terms of RFM values and interpret what each cluster represents in terms of customer behavior and value to the business.

4. Develop targeted marketing strategies for each cluster based on their RFM characteristics. Tailor promotions, messaging, and communication channels to effectively engage each segment of customers.
